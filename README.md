Currently my project downloads the the video file, but I have not implemented the re-trys or successfully been
able to check the file integrity. I chose python because it is easiest to perform a lot of the desired actions
with built in modules. I have never programmed anything with videos before so a lot of my design decisions were
based off of information and code I found online, documented below.
